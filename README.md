### set password level

jb-password has some default validation check series that you can set by just set the `level` prop of the component

```ts
//level list
type PasswordValidationLevel ="NONE" | "BASIC" | "PRO"
//NONE is no default validation
//BASIC just check for password length
//PRO check password length + numeric and special char included
```
```jsx
<JBPasswordInput level="PRO"></JBPasswordInput>
```
you may not set the level and just set your own validation but we put this option for ease of use.
